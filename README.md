# google-docs-mcp

> Surgical Google Docs editing for AI agents — preserves history, never touches character indices.

An MCP server that makes Google Docs actually usable for LLMs. **Standalone** — no other tools required beyond a Google Cloud OAuth app.

Compatibility note: the repo, package, CLI, env vars, and default token path now use `google-docs-mcp`. Backward-compatible `google-drive-mcp` command and env-var aliases are still accepted so existing setups do not break immediately.

Indexing note: when the MCP reads document content before planning index-based edits, it requests `suggestionsViewMode=SUGGESTIONS_INLINE`. That keeps returned indices aligned for later `documents.batchUpdate` calls when the doc contains suggestions.

## Why

The Google Docs API uses **character indices** for every edit. LLMs are bad at counting characters. Everyone ends up deleting and rewriting entire documents, which destroys version history, comments, and collaborator attribution.

This server uses the same abstraction as code editors: **search by text, not by position**. You describe *what* to change; the server finds *where* it is and handles the index arithmetic.

## Quick start

### 1. Run directly from GitHub

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp google-docs-mcp --help
```

That command downloads the package, creates an isolated environment, installs dependencies, and runs the `google-docs-mcp` entry point.

No PyPI release is required. `uvx` can execute the tool straight from the GitHub repository.

To pin to a branch, tag, or commit, add a ref to the URL:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp@main google-docs-mcp --help
```

If you prefer a persistent local install instead of `uvx`, use:

```bash
uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp google-docs-mcp
uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp google-docs-mcp-auth
```

### 2. Create a Google Cloud OAuth app

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project (or select an existing one)
3. Enable these APIs (**APIs & Services → Library**):
   - **Google Docs API**
   - **Google Drive API**
   - **Google Apps Script API** *(for inline-anchored comments)*
4. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
5. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
6. Application type: **Desktop App**
7. Download the JSON file

### 3. Authenticate

**Normal — browser opens automatically:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp \
  google-docs-mcp-auth --credentials ~/credentials.json
```

**Or use env vars instead of a credentials file:**
```bash
export GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
export GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp \
  google-docs-mcp-auth
```

**Headless / remote server — no browser on device:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp \
  google-docs-mcp-auth --credentials ~/credentials.json --headless
# Prints a URL → open on any device (phone, laptop, etc.)
# Paste the full redirect URL back into the terminal
```

**Already have an auth code:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp \
  google-docs-mcp-auth --credentials ~/credentials.json --code "4/0Afr..."
```

`google-docs-mcp-auth` resolves OAuth client credentials in this order:

1. `--credentials /path/to/credentials.json`
2. `--client-id` and `--client-secret`
3. `GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_CLIENT_SECRET`

Token is saved to `~/.google-docs-mcp/token.json` by default. Override with `--out /path/to/token.json`.

### 4. Configure your MCP client

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-docs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp", "google-docs-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_TOKEN": "/Users/you/.google-docs-mcp/token.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**OpenClaw** (gateway config):
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "google-docs": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp", "google-docs-mcp"],
        "env": {
          "GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_TOKEN": "~/.google-docs-mcp/token.json"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Local checkout during development:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-docs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "/absolute/path/to/google-docs-mcp", "google-docs-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_TOKEN": "/Users/you/.google-docs-mcp/token.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Optional: Apps Script bridge for bookmark-jump comments

If you want `docs_add_comment(..., bookmark_jump=true)` to append a real
`#bookmark=id...` jump URL into the comment body, set up one persistent Apps
Script bridge project and expose its script ID via an env var.

Required one-time setup:

1. Enable the **Apps Script API** for the Google account at
   <https://script.google.com/home/usersettings>
2. Create a standalone Apps Script project to use as the bridge
3. In that Apps Script project, open **Project Settings** and switch it to the
   **same standard Google Cloud project** as the OAuth client used by
   `google-docs-mcp`
4. In that same Google Cloud project, ensure **Apps Script API** is enabled
5. Set the bridge script ID in the MCP process environment:

```bash
export GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_APPS_SCRIPT_ID="1C6nchmQRobIwK8ELFe29k-XV2t7mUnhKiSpEKHThXOFHAL6Ahy4_Xju4"
```

Example `uvx` launch with both token + Apps Script bridge:

```bash
GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_TOKEN="$HOME/.google-docs-mcp/token.json" \
GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_APPS_SCRIPT_ID="your-apps-script-id" \
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-docs-mcp google-docs-mcp
```

If the Apps Script bridge is still using its hidden default project, `scripts.run`
fails even when account-level Apps Script access is enabled.

## Tools reference

### Document reading

#### `docs_get(doc_id)`
Read a Google Doc and return its full structure.

Returns the document title, a list of paragraphs (with text, heading style, and character indices), and the full plain text. Use this first to understand the document before making edits.

```
docs_get(doc_id="1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgVE2upms")
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "title": "My Document",
  "paragraphs": [
    {"text": "Introduction", "style": "HEADING_1", "start": 0, "end": 13},
    {"text": "This is the body.", "style": "NORMAL_TEXT", "start": 13, "end": 31}
  ],

| `limit` | int | `20` | Maximum results |

```
docs_list(query="board deck 2026", limit=5)
```

---

### Document editing

All editing tools use **text anchors**, never character indices. The server finds the text and handles the indices internally.

#### `docs_search_replace(doc_id, find, replace, occurrence, regex)`
Find text in a document and replace a specific occurrence.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `doc_id` | string | required | Google Doc ID |
| `find` | string | required | Text to find |
| `replace` | string | required | Replacement text |
| `occurrence` | int | `1` | Which occurrence: `1` = first, `2` = second, `0` = **all** |
| `regex` | bool | `false` | Treat `find` as a Python regex |

```
# Replace first occurrence
docs_search_replace(doc_id="...", find="Q1 2024", replace="Q2 2024")

# Replace all occurrences
docs_search_replace(doc_id="...", find="ACME Corp", replace="Initech", occurrence=0)

# Regex replace
docs_search_replace(doc_id="...", find=r"\bDraft\b", replace="Final", regex=true)
```

---

#### `docs_insert_after(doc_id, anchor, text)`
Insert a new paragraph immediately after the paragraph containing `anchor`.

```
docs_insert_after(
  doc_id="...",
  anchor="Executive Summary",
  text="Updated as of March 2026 following board review."
)
```

---

#### `docs_insert_before(doc_id, anchor, text)`
Insert a new paragraph immediately before the paragraph containing `anchor`.

```
docs_insert_before(
  doc_id="...",
  anchor="Appendix A",
  text="See the following appendix for supporting data."
)
```

---

#### `docs_delete_paragraph(doc_id, anchor)`
Delete all paragraphs containing `anchor` text (case-insensitive).

```
docs_delete_paragraph(doc_id="...", anchor="[PLACEHOLDER — DELETE ME]")
```

---

#### `docs_append(doc_id, text)`
Append a new paragraph at the end of the document.

```
docs_append(doc_id="...", text="Document last updated: March 2026.")
```

---

#### `docs_batch_replace(doc_id, replacements_json)`
Apply multiple find→replace operations **atomically** in a single API call. Either all changes succeed or none do.

```
docs_batch_replace(
  doc_id="...",
  replacements_json='[
    {"find": "[CLIENT]", "replace": "Acme Corp", "occurrence": 0},
    {"find": "[DATE]", "replace": "10 March 2026", "occurrence": 0},
    {"find": "DRAFT", "replace": "FINAL"}
  ]'
)
```

Each item in the array:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `find` | string | required | Text to find |
| `replace` | string | required | Replacement text |
| `occurrence` | int | `1` | `1` = first, `0` = all |
| `regex` | bool | `false` | Regex mode |

---

#### `docs_create(title, initial_text)`
Create a new Google Doc.

```
docs_create(title="Q2 Board Deck", initial_text="Confidential — not for distribution.")
```

Returns `{id, title, webViewLink}`.

---

### Comments

#### `docs_add_comment(doc_id, comment, anchor_text, occurrence, include_anchor_text, bookmark_jump)`
Add a comment anchored to specific text in the document.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `doc_id` | string | required | Google Doc ID |
| `comment` | string | required | Comment text |
| `anchor_text` | string | required | Text in the document to attach the comment to |
| `occurrence` | int | `1` | Which occurrence of `anchor_text` to use |
| `include_anchor_text` | bool | `true` | Append the matched anchor text into the comment body |
| `bookmark_jump` | bool | `false` | Use the Apps Script bridge to create a bookmark and append a jump URL |

Use a short, distinctive phrase for `anchor_text` — a few words that are unique enough to match exactly one location.

```
docs_add_comment(
  doc_id="...",
  anchor_text="unable to perform the Employee's duties",
  comment="Legal risk: 3-month absence threshold may not satisfy Equality Act 2010 duty to make reasonable adjustments before terminating.",
  bookmark_jump=true
)
```

> **Note:** The current implementation uses Drive comments plus a Docs named range. In the Docs UI these still show as *"Original content deleted"* rather than as proper inline highlights. The comments are fully readable via `docs_read_comments` and the Docs 💬 panel.
>
> When `bookmark_jump=true`, the tool additionally uses Apps Script automation to create a bookmark at the anchor text and appends a `#bookmark=id...` jump URL into the comment body. This requires the `GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_APPS_SCRIPT_ID` env var and the Apps Script bridge setup documented above.
>
> A probe helper is included for this workstream:
>
> ```bash
> python3 appscript_probe.py inspect-comment-api --doc-id <DOC_ID>
> ```
>
> The probe now creates an API-executable deployment automatically. If account-level Apps Script access is still disabled, it stops with the settings-page message. If execution fails with a permission error, the next blocker is the shared standard Google Cloud project requirement documented at <https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects>.

---

#### `docs_read_comments(doc_id, include_resolved)`
List all comments on a document.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `doc_id` | string | required | Google Doc ID |
| `include_resolved` | bool | `false` | Include resolved/deleted comments |

Returns an array of comments with `id`, `content`, `author`, `anchored` (bool), `named_range_id`, `quoted_text`, `resolved`, `deleted`, `created`.

```
docs_read_comments(doc_id="...")
```

---

#### `docs_reply_to_comment(doc_id, comment_id, reply)`

## Auth environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_TOKEN` | Path to token file (preferred for standalone use) |
| `GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_CLIENT_ID` | Optional OAuth client ID override |
| `GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Optional OAuth client secret override |
| `GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_APPS_SCRIPT_ID` | Apps Script bridge project ID for `bookmark_jump=true` |
| `GOOGLE_DOCS_TOKEN_FILE` | Legacy alias |
| `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` | Auto-export from gog CLI (for personal/OpenClaw use) |

Legacy `GOOGLE_DRIVE_MCP_*` env var aliases still work for backward compatibility.

---

## Scopes

The auth setup requests these scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` | Read and write Google Docs |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` | Search and read Drive file metadata (powers `docs_list`) |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` | Per-file Drive access, for comments on files this tool created |

Full `auth/drive` (read/write to every file in your Drive) and the three
`script.*` scopes are deliberately not requested. The script scopes serve only
the opt-in bookmark-jump comment bridge and together allow creating and running
arbitrary code in your Google account.

To add comments to documents this tool did not itself create, add
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` back to `SCOPES` in `auth_setup.py` and
re-run it — the Drive comments API cannot reach arbitrary pre-existing files
under `drive.file` alone.
| `openid`, `email`, `profile` | Identity |
